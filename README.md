# Judgementですの！ - How beautiful you are -

Judgement is a one of pretty formatter library for PHP.
this library uses double linked list so easy to modify parsed PHP statement.
and this library highly inspired PhpStorm's code formatting.
i think that function is great but they don't provide CLI tool for us.
so I decided to write this library.
